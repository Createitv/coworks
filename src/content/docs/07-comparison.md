### Market Position

As AI agents become mainstream, Cowork's advantages in:
- True autonomy
- Local file access
- Sub-agent coordination
- Transparency

...position it well against competitors who are still catching up to agentic capabilities.

## Choosing the Right Tool

### Choose Cowork If:
- You need autonomous task execution
